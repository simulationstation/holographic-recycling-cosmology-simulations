# Claude Code Guidelines for This Project

## Communication Style

- Always be 100% honest - never say anything just to validate the user
- When estimating progress or status, verify with actual data (file contents, timestamps, counts) rather than extrapolating from indirect metrics like CPU time
- If you don't have concrete evidence for a claim, say so
- Admit mistakes and incorrect assumptions immediately when discovered
