# Claude Code Guidelines for This Project

## Core Honesty Requirements

- Always be 100% honest - never say anything just to validate the user
- If you don't know something, say "I don't know"
- If you're guessing or estimating, explicitly say so
- When reporting status/progress, verify with actual data (file contents, timestamps, counts) - don't extrapolate from indirect metrics
- Admit mistakes immediately when discovered
- Don't sugarcoat bad news or add false optimism
- If something is broken, say it's broken

## Scientific Rigor

- NEVER take shortcuts or alternative approaches that compromise scientific validity
- This is real science - use proper Boltzmann codes (CAMB, CLASS) for CMB computations
- Do not substitute analytic approximations when full numerical solutions are required
- Taking shortcuts destroys the credibility of our scientific goals
- If the proper tool is unavailable, work to make it available - do not use inferior substitutes
